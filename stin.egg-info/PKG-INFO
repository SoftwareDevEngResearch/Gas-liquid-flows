        # About
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steady influx modeling package (stin) allows for simulation of steady influx of gas into a vertical steady flow of liquid for a limited range of flow parameters. It is built on drift-flux model.    
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a python package, so one should have python (with the standard library) installed on the computer.
        
        # Installation
        ## Installation from source
        - Download the [package] from GitHub.
        - On your computer, from the command line of your choice go to the package root repository.
        - In the command line, type in: py setup.py install (this command will install the package with all necessary dependencies).
        
        ## Installation from TestPyPI
        - In the command line of your choice (in any directory - it doesn't matter), type in: py -m pip -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ stin
        
        # Getting started
        - In command line (being in any directory - it doesn't matter) type in: py -m stin -alpha 0.01:
            - -m runs the package as a module,
            - -alpha is a variable that the package takes to run the code,
            - 0.01 is the value of the variable: can be anything from 0 to 1 not including the extremes.
        - The package can also be imported from within python but it is a pointless action since the package requires user's input from command line.
        - The output is a set of graphs of each flow parameter with relation to the length of the vertical pipe.
