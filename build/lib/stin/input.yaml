# Necessary parameters (sequance is important):
v_L0: 0.5 # m/s - single-phase flow velocity at the bottom of the well
p_0: 10000000 # Pa - single-phase flow pressure at the bottom of the well
L: 100 # m - distance at which boundary conditions for two-phase flow occur
H: 200 # m - depth of the wellbore
h: 0.001 # m - (5cm) spatial step
